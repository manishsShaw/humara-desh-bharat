            Stuffed parathas are seen as the breakfast of champions in northern

            ‘layers of cooked dough,’ and this dish lives up to its moniker.
            After leaving the dough (or atta) to rest overnight, parathas are
            made by cooking the dough on a tava before shallow frying.

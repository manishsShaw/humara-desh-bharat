When it came to construction, no stone was spared. From white marble to pink Dholpur stonr to green Kota stone, white and gray soapstone - everything was utilised to construct elegant statues, idols, figurines, carved panels and elaborate 'jharokas' for gardens and pavilions. The art of carving idols, figurines and utensils out of different types of stone is still in practice in Jaipur, Kota, Barmer, Ajmer and Dungarpur, and these places are worth a visit if you'd like to buy yourself a souvenir.",

Materials that are used include quartz, raw glaze, sodium sulphate, and multani mitti (fuller's earth). The beautiful hues of blue and turquoise are obtained through the use of copper oxide and cobalt oxide which give it a distinctive look. Suitable for everyday use, the biggest advantage of blue pottery is that it does not develop cracks unlike regular earthen pots. Blue pottery is usually designed with Mughal era arabesque patterns, as well as animal and bird motifs. There are a number of products you can purchase including plates, flower vases, soap dishes, surahis (small pitchers), trays, coasters, fruit bowls, door knobs and glazed tiles with hand painted floral designs. The craft is mainly practiced in Jaipur and to a lesser extent in Sanganer, Mahalan, and Neota as well.",
